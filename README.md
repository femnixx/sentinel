**1. The "Elevator Pitch" (The 'Why')**

"Sentinel Food Intelligence is a professional-grade platform designed to monitor global food supply chains for economic volatility and security threats. Unlike static dashboards, SFI is a fully automated 'data factory' that integrates real-time data engineering, predictive machine learning, and defensive cybersecurity protocols to transform raw global market data into actionable risk intelligence."

**2. Core Features**

*🛡️ Cybersecurity (The Shield):*

Implemented Zero-Trust principles with JWT-based authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

Integrated automated Dependency Scanning (Snyk/Trivy) and Rate Limiting to protect against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

*⛓️ Data Engineering (The Pipeline):*

Built a robust ETL/ELT pipeline in Python that ingests data from global sources (e.g., World Bank, OpenFoodFacts).

Designed a PostgreSQL schema with optimized indexing for high-frequency time-series price data.

*🧠 Data Science (The Brain):*

Developed an Anomaly Detection Engine using Statistical Modeling (Z-Score) and Machine Learning to identify price spikes and supply chain "shocks."

Provides Forecasting Models to predict seasonal price fluctuations for essential food staples.

*💻 Software & Web Dev (The Product):*

Backend: A high-performance FastAPI (Python) or Go REST API serving as the secure bridge between the data warehouse and the user.

Frontend: A responsive React/Next.js dashboard featuring interactive maps (Leaflet/Mapbox) and real-time data visualizations (Chart.js/D3).
